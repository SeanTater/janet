# Test Repository

This is a test repository containing various programming examples to demonstrate the indexing and search capabilities of the janet-ai-retriever system.

## Contents

### Rust Library (`src/`)

A sample Rust library demonstrating modern Rust programming patterns:

- **lib.rs**: Main library module with configuration and initialization
- **math.rs**: Mathematical utility functions including basic arithmetic and algorithms
- **http.rs**: HTTP client utilities with request/response handling
- **database.rs**: Database connection pooling and query execution
- **auth.rs**: User authentication and authorization system

### Python Utilities (`utils.py`)

Data processing and analysis utilities written in Python:

- Statistical calculations for numerical data
- JSON file processing with error handling
- Text formatting and transformation functions
- Object-oriented data processing with the `DataProcessor` class

### JavaScript API Client (`api.js`)

A comprehensive HTTP client for RESTful API interactions:

- Promise-based HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Request and response interceptors
- Authentication token management
- Error handling and timeout support
- Utility functions for common operations

## Features Demonstrated

The code in this repository showcases various programming concepts:

1. **Error Handling**: Proper error types and handling patterns in Rust, Python, and JavaScript
2. **Async Programming**: Async/await patterns in all three languages
3. **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes and modules with clear separation of concerns
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation with examples and type hints
5. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration and settings
6. **Network Programming**: HTTP clients and server utilities
7. **Data Processing**: Statistical analysis and data transformation
8. **Authentication**: Token-based authentication systems
9. **Database Operations**: Connection pooling and transaction management

## Usage

This repository is primarily used for testing the semantic search capabilities of the janet-ai-retriever system. The varied content allows for testing different types of queries:

- Function definitions and implementations
- Error handling patterns
- Configuration and setup procedures
- Mathematical operations and algorithms
- Network and HTTP operations
- Database interactions
- Authentication workflows

## Testing Queries

Good test queries for this codebase include:

- "function that adds two numbers"
- "HTTP request handling"
- "database connection management"
- "user authentication system"
- "error handling patterns"
- "configuration setup"
- "mathematical calculations"
- "async programming examples"

The semantic search should be able to find relevant code snippets for each of these concepts across the different programming languages and modules.
